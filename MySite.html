            <h1>Welcome To My Page</h1>
            <p> Hi, my name is <b>Sherelle Robbins</b> and I'm a 26 year old coding student from Birmingham, UK. 
            I'm currently taking part in the <a href="https://blackcodher.com/"> BlackCodher program</a>. 
            <br><br>
            My interest in technology began when I setup a small bedroom studio in my teenage years, recording myself and
            other students from my class. Since then I went onto studying and gaining an A Level & BSc degree in Music Technology at DeMontfort University.
                <br> <br>
                I'm currently a self-employed music artist, and have worked with a range of establishments such as BBC, Elle Magazine, Birmingham Hippodrome, Birmingham Town hall & Symphony hall
                and represented Birmingham in the 2018 Commonwealth Games Closing ceremony in Goldcoast Australia. 
                <br> <br>
                Throughout my years I've understood the importance of represetation of black women in both the music and tech field. And would love to further develop my coding skills to create better communication, software and way of life for music artists like myself. 
            </p>
